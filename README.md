<p>The Backfield is a database management and live broadcasting API for American football statkeeping.</p>


<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>

- C#/ASP.Net
- Entity Framework Core
- SignalR
- postgreSQL
- Swagger (development only)

<h2>User-Specific Data</h2>

Data in The Backfield is user-specific, to the extent that most calls accessing this data must include the user's session key for access verification. Only users with that session key can access/edit that data. For many calls, the session key is passed as a query parameter. For many others, it is included in the request body. 
Session keys are generated on the creation/login of a user via uid. The uid may be handled by any authentication process integrated into the UI (Google Firebase is used in [The Official Backfield UI](http://github.com/alexberka/the-backfield-ui)) or may be manually specified by the user when creating the data. Once the User is created, the associated uid cannot be altered by calls.

<h2 id="started">Getting Started</h2>

Clone this project to a directory on your machine using

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexberka/the-backfield.git
```

Open the solution file in an IDE. In order to initialize the database on your machine and populate with seed data, run:

```
ef database update
```

in the terminal.

<h2>Running the Application</h2>

The application can be started in the terminal is Visual Studio using:

```
dotnet run
```

or started in the debugger. If started with the debugger, the app will enter development mode, and Swagger will automatically open in a new window.

To interact with the API via Postman, access the [The Backfield Documentation on Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/31791227/2sAYBYgWGq) and click "Run in Postman". Choose either the web or desktop app in the popup, select a collection to import into, and click import.

The {{baseUrl}} variable must be adjusted to the proper local port. Find this in your Visual Studio terminal or in the Swagger window if operating in development mode.
